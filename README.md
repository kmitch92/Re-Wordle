# Re-Wordle
A React app Wordle clone

This project was developed within a forked repository during the Northcoders bootcamp, graduating class of September 2022. It was one of my first forays into React apps, and had innocuous beginnings as an exercise to build a single page, simple web-app game. After making some headway with the project I decided to continue with it in my own time, and in case anybody would like to view the code, I have moved it to a new, public repository.
